# FlashCards in Terminal 

## This is the first solo project in module 2 at Turing School for Software and Design in Denver, Co. This program simulates a set of flash cards using the command line. 

## The goals of this project are as follows:
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
